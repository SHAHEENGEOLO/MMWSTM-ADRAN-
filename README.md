# MMWSTM-ADRAN-
MMWSTM-ADRAN+ is a dual-stream DL model for daily climate forecasting. A latent-state LSTM captures weather regimes, while an anomaly-driven attention branch amplifies extremes; a gated fusion blends both. Repo ships data-prep + PyTorch training code, runs in â‰ˆ2 h on 1 GPU (&lt;5 M params), MIT-licensed.
